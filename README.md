## The Problem

Preparing for software engineering interviews is stressful and multifaceted. Candidates need to practice behavioral questions, solve complex technical problems, and ensure their resume is perfectly tailoredâ€”often with little to no expert feedback.

## The Solution

**InterPrep** is a one-stop-shop that leverages the power of AI to act as a personal interview coach. It provides structured, critical, and actionable feedback across the three most important domains of the job search, giving candidates the confidence they need to succeed.

## Core Features

*   **ðŸ¤– Behavioral Prep Gauntlet:** Generate custom behavioral questions based on real-world scenarios. The AI evaluates your answers using the STAR method and provides a brutally honest score and critique from the perspective of a "stern hiring manager."

*   **ðŸ’» Technical Challenge Simulator:** Tackle a LeetCode-style data structures and algorithms problem. A "senior engineer" AI persona reviews your code not just for correctness, but for time/space complexity, optimization potential, and code style.

*   **ðŸ“„ Instant Resume Review:** Get your resume analyzed by a "senior tech recruiter" AI. It provides an immediate score and critical, actionable advice on how to improve your resume's impact and clarity.

*   **ðŸŽ¨ Cohesive Themed UI:** Each tool is styled with a unique, memorable "sticky note" theme to create a polished and intuitive user experience.
